                        <p>We founded One Great Coffee a few years back.</p>
                        <p>We make our own coffee special by the way we make it, the ingredients we use, and through the
                            rituals
                            we associate with it. Coffee is much more to coffee lovers than a mere relaxing beverage or
                            a
                            quick
                            energy drink.</p>
                        <p>Our roastmasters do not roast your coffee until your order is received. Freshly roasted
                            coffee is
                            smoother than you can imagine and is often gentler in acidity with subtle flavor nuances.
                            Next,
                            we
                            wanted coffee that was second-to-none. The coffee we sell contains nothing but the best! We
                            are
                            talking about Specialty Graded One coffee beans.</p>
